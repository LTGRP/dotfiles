# My dotfiles

This is my home directory. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Getting started

Here is how to get this back up and installed on a new machine

### Prerequisites

* Bash
* Git

I'm pretty sure that's it, actually.

### Installing the dotfiles

First look in .gitignore and back up any files in your homedir that this overwrites that you care about.
Then you'll need to clone this repo to an empty directory and then move the files into your home

```
~$ mkdir clonehere
~$ cd clonehere
~/clonehere$ git clone <repo uri>
# This will overwrite things! So back things up or whatever.
~/clonehere$ mv ./* ~/
```

### Further setup

Git, vim and audacity configs refer to external plugins/utilities/whatever which are not included in this repo.

So included here is a prompt in bashrc to install git helpers, and then setup scripts for Vim and Audacity plugins:
```
~/.audacity-files/setup.sh
~/.vim/setup.sh
```
