# My dotfiles

This is my home directory. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Getting started

Here is how to get this back up and installed on a new machine

### Prerequisites

* Bash
* Git

I'm pretty sure that's it, actually.

### Installing the dotfiles

First look in .gitignore and back up any files in your homedir that this overwrites that you care about.
Then you'll need to clone this repo to an empty directory and then move the files into your home

```
~$ mkdir clonehere
~$ cd clonehere
~/clonehere$ git clone <repo uri>
# This will overwrite things! So back things up or whatever.
~/clonehere$ mv ./* ~/
```

### Git shell helpers

Bash will prompt you to install git-completion and git-prompt scripts when you open a terminal.

### Vim Plugins

Vundle (Vim plugin manager) must be installed first
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

And then you can install the rest of the plugins from the .vimrc like so
```
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```
